LIFECYCLE
Life Cycle of Activity and Fragment ?

When activity A is opened -> It's life cycle 
When another activity is opened, life cycle of previous and current activity.
When you press back button on Activity B -> then life cycle of Activity B and Activity A in sequence.
What will happend when you call finish() in onCreate

Life cycle of a fragment:
i. When A fragment is opened -> life cycle
ii. When B fragment is opened -> life cycle of A and B both fragment.
iii. When B is destroyed sequence life cycle of B and A Fragment

Difference between add() and replace() method of a fragment

 when onSaveInstance() is called?
 When you show dialog on a fragment/activity which lifecycle method will be called?
 When you get a call on your phone which life cycle method will be called?

Based on #broadcastreceiver)

 How many types of broadcast receiver we have in android:
 Local -> use only when broadcast is used only inside same process.
Normal -> use sendBroadcast(), Asynchronous broadcast.
Ordered -> use sendOrderedBroadcast(), synchronous broadcast.
Sticky -> normal broadcast intent is not available any more after this was send and processed by the system. use sendStickyBroadcast(Intent)


Do you know that local broadcast receiver is deprecated?
Alternate for the same?
What would you use and how would you communicate between Services and Activities/Fragments now?

3. Example of Sticky broadcast receiver?

If you've answers of above questions, 99% are chances you'll clear your Kotlin round for sure. Before your next interview brush-up your skills and you're good to go.

Feel free to like, comment and share this post with your connection so it would also help them in clearing their interviews rounds.

g. Difference between add() and replace() method of a fragment

h. when onSaveInstance() is called?

i. When you show dialog on a fragment/activity which lifecycle method will be called?

j. When you get a call on your phone which life cycle method will be called?

Difference between concurrency and parallelism?
With the popularity of coroutines this question is also asked in almost every interview(9/10).
it's not a 2 or 5 marks question where you can escape by telling only the differences between them. interviewer wants to know How deep you can go depending upon your experiences.

If you don't know the depth don't worry I'm here to help.

List Of followup questions:
1. Why coroutine is preferred over thread ?
2. 1 coroutine is running on 1 thread
3. 10 coroutines running on 1 thread
4. 10 coroutines running on 3,4,5..n threads.
5. Maximum parallell work can be performed on a processor.
6. Why coroutines are called lightweight thread?
7. You can create 1000 coroutines but not threads?
8. What would happen if you create 1000 threads.
9. Maximum threads can be created ?
10. Why Performance overhead if we create so many threads ?
goes on.....

Question3: This is very important question asked in every android dev interview.
a. Internal working of viewmodel and how it survives configuration changes but not onBackPress()
b. How would you decide Which data you should store in fragment/activity and which one in viewmodel? -> this is important because android os may clean up the resources of viewmodel due to less memory.

Life cycle of a View
People usually read about lifecycle of activity , fragment but many #androiddevs don't know about view's lifecycle which is crucial and quite important from performance perspective as well. if Ui is designed carefully it'll boost the performance of your application for sure.

Q4: if your design round is coming up
“Design analytics library” should be your first priority.

Let me help you with this.

Make sure you ask/include following points while designing any analytics library:

1. Priorities of events: Immediate/Medium/Low
2. Offline support- if network is not available or events failed during network call
3. Maximum memory allocation for offline support(ex. If you’ve events stored for 5 days and still couldn’t reach to server due to any reason, should we remove those      events or not from local storage)
4. Retry whenever network comes
5. Batch size define based in network type(2g,3g,4g, wifi).
6. Url configurations: should we keep url fixed or user should defined
7. Overloaded function for passing single event/multiple events
8.Implement abstraction- in future you might have to change analytics library.
9.Library support for current project or multiple?
10.Retry network call or change in batch size if api fails.
Q6: Design Image loading library like Glide in android
From this question #interviewer will check how well do you know about.
a. Memory leaking-> because glide hold the reference of images/context(If activity or fragment is destroyed after that your bitmap is downloaded and then if library try to set bitmap in your image). You can read more on:
i. Causes for memory leaking
ii How to avoid memory leak.
b. Garbage collector -> in which thread it runs(another interview question)
c. Your design knowledge: You can read about java design patterns.
d. LRU cache (VV IMP) -> LinkedHashMap is used internally and used on so many places. Must read, Very interesting also. I can't even describe here the benefits of LRU cache and LinkedHashMap.
e. Disk cache, Thread pool(if 1000 images need to download in parallel) , Executor service, Handle duplicate request for same image:
f. Types of references android has: (Really helpful in avoiding memory leak)
i. Weak ii. Soft iii. Phantom iv. Strong
